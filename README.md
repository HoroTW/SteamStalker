# STEAMSTALKER

This is a simple python script that will notify you via a telegram bot, when a steam friend of yours starts a game.
It is very straightforward without any fancy or complicated features.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository and `cd` into it
2. [Optional] Create a virtual environment e.g. with `python -m venv .venv`
3. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Copy the .env.example file to .env and fill in the required values
   1. You can get your steam api key [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
   2. The Bot token can be obtained by creating a new bot with the [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
   3. Add the bot to a group chat with you and run the script once (`python SteamStalker.py`) to get the chat id.
5. Run the script with `python SteamStalker.py`
6. [Optional] Create a Service to start the script on boot
